  <p>My name is Sam Roizen (KD2YYK). I have been a licensed Ham Radio Operator since March 14th, 2022. I am a member of ARES in the NYC-Long Island Section and a member of the New York City Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Service. I frequently participate in Nets and informal conversations on the Limarc Repeater Network and often will be found passing Radiogram Traffic on the Big Apple NTS Traffic Net.</p>
