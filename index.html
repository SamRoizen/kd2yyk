  <h1>KD2YYK</h1>
  
 
  <p>My name is Sam Roizen (KD2YYK). I have been a licensed Ham Radio Operator since March 14th, 2022. I am a member of ARES in the NYC-Long Island Section and a member of the New York City Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Service. I frequently participate in Nets on the Limarc Repeater Network and often will be found passing Radiogram Traffic on the Big Apple NTS Traffic Net. <br><br>On this website, you will find information about repeaters in NYC and the Tri-State area, nets to look out for, and other resources. The Resources & Docs page holds various resources in the form of links, PDFs, etc...</p>
